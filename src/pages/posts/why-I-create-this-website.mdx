## My previous experience of building a blog website
It's been 8 years since I published my first self-built blog website, the project was [open-sourced](https://github.com/edxzh/xingishere) and mainly built on `Ruby On Rails` and `bootstrap`, you might still able to run it locally today if you are lucky, it was my second year as a full time backend developer after I graduated, My intension was to use this project as an opportunity to increase my web development skills, so I can be more eligible for my professional job.

With the help offered by my colleagues at the time, the project goes pretty well, after the first version release, I became ambitious and add as much technologies as possible, though it might not necessary for a blog website. some of the technologies are still being well adopted these days, like `mongoDB`, `memcached` for cache, all data is kept in `mysql`, I also add `https` certificate, and `nginx` as reverse proxy before unicorn(a ruby gem), you name it! visitors are able to signup and comment on my blogs, also subscribe so they can get a well styled weekly email. I put a ton of effort on it, you can get it from over `800` commits it has, all my effort pays off - I learnt a lot from it and become confident in my professional area.

I was quite excited after I first deployed it in `digitalOcean`, then tried to add more blogs in the following one or two years, most of the blogs are about `ruby on rails`, some of them were popular, the feeling of being recognized is superb.

the website was out of service after about 3 years, when I felt I don't know what to write about for a long while, I allow the domain expired and stop paying digitalOcean for the instance fee, what's interesting is the domain was soon bought by someone else who deployed a porn site on it ðŸ˜ž.

## why I'm doing it again
certainly, I'd like to check out the newest framework of front-end, front-end has been rapidly envolving these years, again, I'd utilize this idea as an opportunity to try something new.
on top of that, I'm approaching my 10 years working anniversary, sometimes I feel there are a lot of ideas in my head, but most of the flash away right away, which I'd have noted down and explore further, it's a privilege to analyse one's own mind.
besides that, I never realize writing skill is essential in the working space until I joined my current company, I was simply shocked after I randomly picked up some blogs from the popular feed, to make a good blog, you have to scheme out the steps of demonstrating your ideas best to the readers, it drives you to drill down the detail of the topic, your writing skill can colorize a boring story and make it attractive, reading an amazing blog is like a breeze in the hot days.

## how long it takes me to build this website
I didn't count every hours I commited so I can not give a clear answer, you can probably check out the analytics from github, yes this website is also [open-sourced](https://github.com/edxzh/edwardzhou.com), the majority of development time was spent on the `CSS`.

## some tech detail about this website
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is the main language for the project, though there isn't much typescript code so far.
* [AstroJs](https://astro.build/) is the main framework for the website, I was surprised on how easy it is to build a static site with it.
* [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is my go-to css library for my personal project, I'd not hesitate to recommend it to any individual developer or small start-ups. it's super fast to craft a beautiful website with it.
* [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) is another straightforward javascript framework, you can learn how to use it in 5 mins with the examples on the official website.
* [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) helps with the deployment, once main branch was updated it can deploy to production in 2 mins.
