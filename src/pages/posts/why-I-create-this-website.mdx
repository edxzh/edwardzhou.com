## My previous experience of building a blog website
It's been 8 years since I published my first self-built blog website, the project was [open-sourced](https://github.com/edxzh/xingishere) and mainly built on `Ruby On Rails` and `bootstrap`, you might still able to run it locally today if you are lucky, it was my second year as a full time backend developer after I graduated, My intension was to use this project as an opportunity to increase my web development skills, so I can be more eligible for my professional job.

With the help offered by my colleagues at the time, the project goes pretty well, after the first version release, I became ambitious and add as much technologies as possible, though it might not necessary for a blog website. some of the technologies are still being well adopted these days, like `mongoDB`, `memcached` for cache, all data is kept in `mysql`, I also add `https` certificate, and `nginx` as reverse proxy before unicorn(a ruby gem), you name it! visitors are able to signup and comment on my blogs, also subscribe so they can get a well styled weekly email. I put a ton of effort on it, you can get it from over `800` commits it has, all my effort pays off - I learnt a lot from it and become confident in my professional area.

I was quite excited after I first deployed it in `digitalOcean`, then tried to add more blogs in the following one or two years, most of the blogs are about `ruby on rails`, some of them were popular, the feeling of being recognized is superb.

the website was out of service after about 3 years, when I felt I don't know what to write about for a long while, I allow the domain expired and stop paying digitalOcean for the instance fee, what's interesting is the domain was soon bought by someone else who deployed a porn site on it üòû.

## why I'm doing it again
I'm entering into 10 years working anniversary very soon,
